I have a remote controlled car:

I want to be able to decide on the colour of the car.

I want to be able to choose between rechargable and disposable batteries.

I want to choose between a simple and an advanced remote control.

I want to be able to see the battery percentage remaining.

I want to be able to move the car forward and backward a specific distance.

I want to be able to stop the car from moving.

I want to be able to turn the car left and right.

I want to be able to replace the battery with either kind as needed.
